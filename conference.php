					</div>
					<p>
						<strong>I. IDEATION: HOW TO CREATE YOUR INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE 
							BUSINESS PLAN </strong><br><br>
							A business plan is a tool for understanding how your business is put together. 
							It is used to monitor progress and decide the business’s fate. Writing out your 
							business plan forces you to review everything at once: your value proposition, 
							marketing assumptions, operations plan, financial plan and stating plan. 
							You'll end up spotting connections you otherwise would have missed. 
							Hence it is very important to have an innovative and creative business 
							plan-it’s a tool for employees and investors alike. <br /> 
							<strong><br><br>
								II. Product Designing and Prototyping</strong><br><br> 
								Nothing brings you closer to the functionality of the final product than 
								prototyping. While wireframes sketch out the blueprint and mockups show 
								the feel and texture of the design, it is the prototype that brings to life the 
								“experience” behind “user experience.The idea behind this session is to 
								discuss how essential is a prototype of a product, its advantages and how 
								to get started with envisioning your idea in a multi-dimensional field of view. 
								<br > <strong><br><br>
								III. Business Intelligence and Valuation </strong>
								The concept of business intelligence (BI) is used to refer to various 
								processes, products, techniques, or tools that enhance the decision making 
								process. Using BI tools, a company can anticipate and understand various 
								phenomena and trends in its market areas and, also, learn more about its 
								customer’s preferences and competitors actions. Over the past few years, 
								the Business Intelligence and Analytics space has seen strong exit activity 
								from internet, mobile, and software based startups. It’s time to learn how 
								Business Intelligence can propel your business toward success. 
								<br> <strong><br><br>
								IV. A. Open Source Vs Patents</strong> <br><br>

								Open Source is a widely used word in the world of computer technology 
								and while it started out as a term in the context of software development, 
								today it has gone beyond the 0s and 1s. Open source projects, products, or 
								initiatives are those that embrace and celebrate open exchange, 
								collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and 
								above all community development. But is open source the right way to move 
								forward or is it yet another idealistic movement that is fundamentally 
								flawed? This session will explore these concepts and help you get better 
								grasp on what is right for your business. <br><strong><br><br>

								IV. B. Disruptive Innovation Vs Incremental Innovation</strong> <br><br>
								A disruptive innovation is an innovation that creates value network and 
								eventually disrupts an existing market and value network, displacing 
								established market leaders and alliances. Whereas incremental innovations 
								involve modest changes to existing products and services. 
								These are enhancements that keep a business competitive, such as new 
								product features and service improvements. <br><strong><br><br>

								V. Storytelling and PR for startups </strong><br><br>
								“Apple tried to use evidence to persuade IT execs and big companies to 
								adopt the Mac during the 80s”, explains Seth Godin, the king of marketing 
								and the ultimate storyteller. “They tried ads and studies that proved the 
								Mac was easier and cheaper to support. They failed. It was only the gentle 
								persistence of storytelling and the elevation of evangelists that turned 
								the tide”. Stories have power. They delight, enchant, touch, teach, recall, 
								inspire, motivate, challenge. They help us understand. The session will 
								concentrate on storytelling for uplifting the public relations of a startup 
								or company its relevance in business. 
								<br > <strong><br><br>
								VI. Product performance and channelization </strong><br><br>
								How well does a product perform and how to check if your product is giving 
								you the output you require. Also how to assess and work upon the customer 
								feedback that you receive. 
								<br />

								<h4>Day 3 - <span>SCALING</span></h4>
							</div>
							<p>
								<strong>I. Bootstrapping vs Funding </strong><br><br>
								The session will encompass the various pros and cons of being a 
								bootstrapped or a funded startup. Seeing the unprecedented rise in the the 
								startup community in the last few years, people wonder which option to 
								go for.The luxury of freedom in a bootstrapped startup against the 
								accelerated growth of a funder one, we will be pondering over many such 
								aspects. 
								<br /> 
								<strong><br><br>
									II. The art of selling and negotiations.</strong><br><br> 
									Negotiating is a part of everyday life, but in business it's absolutely critical 
									to your success. Poor negotiation can cripple a company just as quickly as 
									losing key customers. Many people believe that negotiations are "all or 
									nothing", and that there has to be one winner and one loser. Nothing 
									could be farther from the truth. While the goal of negotiation is most 
									certainly getting what you want, the fact is that incorporate terms and 
									ideas from both parties. The session will open the horizon for this art , allow 
									it to unfurl and bring it to your hands and understanding. 
									<br > <strong><br><br>
									III. The creator’s code </strong>
									The truth is coders gravitate towards other coders. As Ben Parr, a former 
									editor at Mashable, stated, "You have to code, not because you need to be 
									good at it, but because technical employees are far more likely to follow a 
									founder with technical experience." Here we will be discussing on the 
									essential coding skills that one has to possess to be a great entrepreneur. 
									Knowing the basics reassures potential investors and earns the respect of 
									the techies you need to join your team. 
									<br> <strong><br><br>
									IV.  Disrupting Cash – The changing Payment Landscape </strong> <br><br>
									The advent of internet has revolutionised personal finance and the overall 
									way payments are made. Online banking has almost replaced the traditional 
									banking systems. Originally intended as a way to carry ecash, digital wallets 
									have evolved into a way for smartphone and internet users to make 
									purchases, receive electronic receipts, and access o ers, coupons, loyalty 
									rewards, and product information. And with digital currency options like “Bitcoin”, one can visualise a day when banks will no longer be needed. 
									In this session, we discuss the ongoing trends of how payments are done 
									and what does it hold for upcoming and existing enterprises. <br><strong><br><br>

									V. Financial Analytics </strong> <br><br>
									A company’s financial data provides a provides an insight into the 
									company’s performance.It is imperative for the growth of a company not 
									only because it touches all parts of the company, but because it is 
									particularly useful in the context of profitability-a very important component 
									of business success and performance management. To fully understand 
									the factors driving the business requires timely financial information 
									combined with data from across the company value chain. <br><strong><br><br>

									VI. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATION </strong><br><br>
									Innovation has become critical to the long-term health of a business. No 
									longer can accompany rest on its laurels and keep doing “business as usual”. 
									The first and most important reason for any new development is to provide 
									new value to the customer. This new and increasing value is what keeps 
									companies growing. New products and services are the lifeblood of any 
									company. Hence the potential of innovative product development should 
									be identified.

									<h4>Day 4 - <span>IMPLEMENTATION</span></h4>
								</div>
								<p>
									<strong>I. A. Marketing Analytics  </strong><br><br>
									How to efficiently market your products by analyzing the market so that 
									you can optimize your return on investment allowing you to minimize your 
									cost on marketing ventures. 

									<br /> 
									<strong><br><br>
										II.  Branding and Ad-Making</strong><br><br> 
										When the market is saturated with businesses that run on closely similar 
										models and provide similar services or products, how will your target customer 
										identify with you? This is where branding steps in. It's primary objective is to 
										establish awareness and preference for your product or service. AdMaking 
										and Branding are an art that involve knowing your audience, identifying 
										the key benefits and playing your cards right to build a strong relationship 
										with your customers. Delve in to know more about the art of branding and 
										advertising. 



										<br > <strong><br><br>
										III. A. Red Ocean Innovation Vs. Blue Ocean Innovation 
									</strong>
									Red oceans are all the industries in existence today – the known market 
									space, where industry boundaries are defined and companies try to 
									outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of the existing market. Cut 
									throat competition turns the ocean bloody red. Hence, the term ‘red’ oceans. 
									Blue oceans denote all the industries not in existence today – the unknown 
									market space, unexplored and untainted by competition. Like the ‘blue’ 
									ocean, it is vast, deep and powerful –in terms of opportunity and profitable 
									growth.So, do you want to beat the competition or make it irrelevant? Join 
									us in this session to know more about how these things work.
									<br> <strong><br><br>
									IV. B. Start-up Legalities and IPR </strong> <br><br>
									The session would emphasize on the organization and financing of the 
									company with a proper examination of a broad array of law-sensitive issues 
									relating to intellectual property, international trade, the duties of directors and 
									o icers, business disputes, and bankruptcy and reorganization and other 
									must-know legal concepts for business owners. The goal is not to impart 
									technical legal skills, but to enhance the judgment which people will bring 
									to their responsibilities as entrepreneurs, managers in established companies, 
									or consultants and advisors.  <br><strong><br><br>

									V. Data Science and Analytics 
								</strong> <br><br>
								Analyzing the data your enterprise receives and drawing conclusions about 
								the information allowing you to verify or jettison your prevailing models or 
								theories. <br><strong><br><br>

								VI. Operations of startup/Making business easy and awesome 
							</strong><br><br>
							You formed the idea and even managed to gather the resources 
							required, buts it’s not all about that.It’s about running your startup well and 
							executing on your business objectives.In a startup environment the 
							COO has to be a wearer of many hats.It’s about how you take care 
							of the little things to make sure that the big things fall into place. 
							As they say,it’s not the climbing the mountain that wears you 
							out…..it’s the pebble in your shoe.

							<h4>Day 5 - <span>SUSTANING</span></h4>
						</div>
						<p>
							<strong>I. Business of Online Content   </strong><br><br>
							For more startups today, content is king it is the currency of cachet. The 
							competition is fierce and to cut through the noise you need to connect with 
							your customer group more than ever. An increasing number of startups are 
							coming up which not just use content to boost their presence but run content 
							oriented businesses. Be it that uber cool youtube channel that makes 
							comedic sketches or that listicle publishing blog, they are all making 
							moolah by creating online content. Find out how this works and what 
							makes them this awesome. 

							<br /> 
							<strong><br><br>
								II. A. Strategic HR management/Basics of booking talent </strong><br><br> 
								A thorough insight into the basics of human resource management 
								philosophy and how to guide and align HRM philosophy, tactical planning 
								and practice with the strategic and long term goals of the organization 
								regarding planning, structure, quality, culture, values, commitment, matching 
								resources to future needs and other longer term people issues.

								<br > <strong><br><br>
								III. Making a Social Change 
							</strong>
							The nascent field of social entrepreneurship is attracting increased 
							attention from many sectors. Social entrepreneurs drive social innovation 
							and transformation with entrepreneurial zeal, business methods and the 
							courage to innovate and overcome traditional practices. We will be learning 
							more about how to create an impact being a visionary and a realist in 
							this session. At the end of the day ideas, that improve people's lives are 
							ideas worth sharing.

																		<p>Arunachalam Muruganantham is a social entrepreneur from Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, India. He invented a set of machines which manufacture sanitary pads for women at a lower price and the best part is that he is employing women to make these pads, thus creating job opportunities for them. Needless to say, menstruation being considered as a taboo in India, it was a humongous task for him and it came at a great personal cost. But he fought against all the odds to create a solution for this major problem women are facing. His achievement has won him many accolades from around the world; he is also the recipient of the coveted Padma Shri award by the President of India. In 2014, TIME magazine placed him in its list of 100 Most Influential People in the World. </p>
