authorized centres at the venue of the conference as well as at the place of stay for the convenience of
 
all the delegates. These centres shall fetch them quick currency exchange during all days of the

delegates to the  venue shall not just be their concern, but ours too.
 
We have exclusive travelling assistance scheme which is divided into three major categories:<br>

 
<h5>Category A </h5> <p> It is the Travelling support cell which caters to the 24*7 support at the airport. This cell
 
shall also be assisting the delegates in providing booking assistance  to make their trip
 
more economical and convenient. The ticket tracking system, which is an integral part of this cell,
 
shall monitor the travel issues of the delegates at all stages of their journey.
 
A prime feature of this cell is to ensure discounted flight tickets for the delegates, even for the pre and
 
post conference trips, through the major partnership of ‘Air India’ flights.<br></p>
 
<h5>Category B</h5> <p> It is the ‘Travel  Insurance’ scheme which is yet another effort of the delegate relations team
 
in order to make the journey safe and insured. Our exclusive travel insurance is sponsored by revered
 
insurance giants as SBI, HDFC, Travel AIG and ICICI. This scheme shall insure the delegates on
 
issues like missed flights, loss of personal baggage and cancellation of flights. <br> </p>

							<h4><span>It’s all about you, delegates</span></h4>

<br> <p>
Our welcome gift to the delegates shall be a ‘kit’ which include a few items of significant
 
utility. This kit shall contain a first aid kit to cater to the immediate medical issues, a set of
 
location maps in order to facilitate the nearby locations and venue directions and a free SIM
 
card with a local number in order to cut down the ISD roaming rates of the delegates.

holy God. We have extended our sincere efforts to provide separate prayer room to the
 
delegates from the diverse communities during the conference trip.

							<h4><span>We shall be alert!</span></h4>

One of the major responsibilities of the delegate relations is to ensure complete safety and
 
security of the delegates during the complete visit. Apart from the crucial content of the kit
 
provided to the delegates, each delegate shall be monitored under the exclusive surveillance
 
of the central control room.
 
The delegates shall travel only in authorized vehicles and transportation . We will

‘All work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy!’
 
This famous quote has been one of our favorite of all time for the simple reason that it is all
 
about the relaxing moments during the tensed hours of work!
 
At delegate relations, it shall be our duty to make sure that you just don’t have the
 
brainstorming panels of this visionary conference but also some cherishing moments of
 
hangouts and fun.The prime hangout zones shall have some exquisite features as star gazing,
 
soft music, barbeque, bonfires and much more. The artificial KISS Lake and such other
 
venues shall be available for boating and other water sports.
 
A set of pre and post conference trips shall also be made available for the delegates
 
circumscribing the tourist venues of Odisha and India.

Being a host to this esteemed conference would not just consist of dire responsibilities and
 
duties but also a glorious opportunity to welcome the delegate guests from the various parts
 
of the globe. It would be a pleasure to witness the get together of cultures, languages, feelings
 
and humanity at large. Keeping this in mind, we shall make sure that the global
 
community has all the ease to make it to our venue.
 
Thus, we have an exclusive ‘Scholarship program’ for the delegates, which shall get them a
 
significant waiver in their registration and accommodation costs. This program shall be
 
implemented through a specified form that shall be made available to all the delegates at the
 
time of registrations. The discretion regarding the selection of waived delegates under this
 
program shall be made exclusively by the organising committee.
 
 We have a second scholarship programme. We will include a competition where the
 
delegates with an entrepreneurial outlook can share their ideas and past achievements in
 
startups. The best ideas will win the opportunity to be a part of a “Networking Dinner” where
 
the delegates will meet the esteemed guests and speakers, and socialize with them. Also,
 
every delegate shall get an opportunity to feature for a live interview in the national channel ­
 
Kalinga TV .

							<h4><span>Never Say Goodbye!</span></h4>
						</div>
				
<p>
 

 
In India, we have a strong belief that says ‘one must never farewell the guests empty
 
handed!’ Hence, we have a special surprise gift for each of our guests and delegates at the
 
end of this glorious meet.
 
One of the greatest visionaries of India, Swami Vivekananda has said,” You cannot believe in
 
God until you believe in yourself.”  We at KIIT  have pledged to believe in every aspect of
 
our efforts. We promise to make the 5­day conference a memorable one. And in this promise,
 
lies a faith that we, as a team will remain dedicated at all stages of visit of the delegates.
 
Hospitality is a part of our ‘code of conduct’ and we shall abide by it. We once again
 
welcome you to our land, to a visionary annual summit, to witness the living diversity and
 
live every bit of it and wish you a happy come back once again to cherish the same, for we
 
believe a guest must never say ‘goodbye’.

Introducing a unique delegate service program, the LO system. This program looks into the very
 
details of the requirements and conveniences of the delegates. The program initiates from the
 
very moment a delegate confirms his registration procedures for the conference.
 
The complete conference and delegate program shall be represented through our ‘Liaison
 
Officers’. Just as a Liaison Officer liaises between two organizations, similarly our officer will be
 
a companion who will ensure that the delegates have a hustle free conference.
 
Soon after the confirmation of the registration procedures, an officer shall be allotted to every
 
five delegates. This 1:5 ratio shall be maintained and that particular officer shall be just as a
 
friend, available 24*7 for any kind of assistance, until the end of conference.

cuisines and other services in the locality.
